        <p>Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll
            provide an overview of what Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Join?</h2>

        <p>Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of
            their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
        </p>

        <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users
            manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
        </p>

        <p>It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive
            business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
            availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.
